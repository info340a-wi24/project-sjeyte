            <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
            <p>Many people struggle with mental health issues like anxiety and depression, especially during difficult times. The pandemic has exacerbated these issues, emphasizing the need for accessible mental health care. Minority groups often face additional barriers to accessing mental health support, such as stigma, lack of culturally competent care, and socioeconomic disparities.</p>
            <p><strong>Existing Attempts:</strong> Several mental health apps exist, offering services ranging from mood tracking to guided meditation. However, gaps in accessibility and personalization remain, particularly for underserved communities.</p>

            <h2>Web App Description</h2>
            <p>Harmony is a mental wellness platform tailored for anyone seeking support, with a focus on accessibility. My aim is to provide a space where users can easily find and engage with mental health resources, fostering a community that supports each individual's journey towards better mental health.</p>
            <img src="../img/harmony-mockup.png" alt="Harmony app mockup" width="100%">
            <p>Upon signing up, users will complete an initial survey or questionnaire that assesses their mental health based on their responses. This survey will help provide a preliminary diagnosis and guide users towards relevant resources and support within the app.</p>
            <p>Users engage with Harmony through features like the Mood Tracker, for logging emotional states; Guided Meditation, for relaxation; Resource Directory, for educational content; and Personalized Recommendations, which suggest activities based on user preferences, demographics, and the results of their initial assessment. These tools are designed to be interactive, allowing users to actively participate in their mental wellness journey by providing inputs, making selections, and receiving tailored content.</p>
            <p>Harmony addresses the need for accessible mental health support by offering a platform where users can discover culturally relevant resources, connect with others who share similar experiences, and receive personalized care based on their individual needs. This approach empowers users to take steps towards improving their mental health in a supportive, engaging environment.</p>
